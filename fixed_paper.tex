\section*{Abstract}
This study explores the determinants of national Olympic medal
    performance and the emergence of first-time medalist countries using
    comprehensive datasets from all Summer Olympic Games. Leveraging
    multivariate linear regression and weighted modeling techniques, we
    predict gold and total medal counts for each country, incorporating
    uncertainty estimates and evaluating model performance through robust
    validation metrics. Our projections for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer
    Olympics include detailed prediction intervals, identifying countries
    poised for improvement and those likely to experience declines compared
    to the 2024 Games. Additionally, the model accounts for nations that
    have yet to secure Olympic medals, providing probabilistic forecasts on
    the number of countries expected to achieve their first podium finishes
    in 2028, along with associated confidence levels. The relationship
    between the number and types of Olympic events and national medal
    outcomes is examined, highlighting key sports that significantly
    influence medal prospects for various countries and the impact of host
    nation event selections on performance. Furthermore, we investigate the
    "great coach" effect by employing Difference-in-Differences (DID)
    analysis and case studies of renowned coaches who have led multiple
    national teams to Olympic success. This analysis quantifies the
    contribution of exceptional coaching to medal counts and identifies
    strategic investment areas for three selected countries to enhance their
    Olympic performance through elite coaching. The findings offer novel
    insights into the dynamics of Olympic medal distributions and provide
    actionable recommendations for national Olympic committees to optimize
    their strategies in athlete development, event participation, and
    coaching investment

    \protect\phantomsection\label{bookmark3-1}{}\textbf{1.1 Background}
    
    \textbf{The Olympic Games have evolved dramatically from their ancient
    origins, when participation was limited to Greek-speaking athletes i .
    Today, they stand as the world\textquotesingle s premier international
    sporting event, symbolized by the iconic five interlocking rings
    designed by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern
    Olympics z . These rings, reprzesenting the five continents, perfectly
    embody the Games\textquotesingle{} inclusive spirit and global reach.}
    
    \textbf{Since their modern revival in 1896, the Olympics have maintained
    a quadrennial schedule, with events spanning no more than 18 days.
    Throughout their modern history, the Games have demonstrated remarkable
    resilience, having been interrupted only during the two World Wars
    (cancelling the 1916, 1940, and 1944 events) and experiencing a single
    postponement in 2020 due to the global pandemic.}
    
    \textbf{Beyond their sporting significance, the Olympics serve as a
    powerful catalyst for urban transformation and economic development in
    host cities ii. This legacy extends far beyond the competition itself,
    often resulting in improved infrastructure, increased tourism, and
    lasting socioeconomic benefits for the host nation iii.}
    \end{quote}
    
    \textbf{The 2024 Paris Olympics will showcase 329 gold medal events
    across 32 sports iv, with each precious medal containing six grams of
    pure gold and weighing 524 grams in total v. As the Games approach,
    global attention has increasingly focused on the medal count
    predictions, with media outlets and sports analysts from various
    countries already speculating about their nations\textquotesingle{}
    potential performance. This phenomenon reflects how Olympic medals have
    become not just symbols of athletic excellence, but also a measure of
    national pride and sporting prowess on the world stage.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \protect\phantomsection\label{bookmark4-1}{}\textbf{1.2 Restatement of
    Problems}
    
    \textbf{The aim of this study is to develop advanced, data-driven
    predictive models to accurately forecast medal standings for the 2028
    Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games. Utilizing historical data on past
    medal counts, host nations, and event distributions, the study seeks to
    address the following critical challenges:}
    
    \textbf{1. Medal Count Prediction:}
    
    \textbf{Construct predictive models for forecasting the number of gold
    medals and overall medal counts for each National Olympic Committee
    (NOC) participating in the 2028 Games. The models will incorporate
    uncertainty estimates and evaluate their predictive accuracy using
    robust performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean
    Absolute Error}
    
    \textbf{(MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). These metrics
    will ensure rigorous validation of the models\textquotesingle{}
    reliability and precision.}
    
    \textbf{1. Medal Ranking Forecasting:}
    \end{quote}
    
    \textbf{Based on the predictive outputs, estimate the final medal
    rankings for each country in the 2028 Olympics, including prediction
    intervals to account for uncertainty. Additionally, identify nations
    likely to exhibit notable improvements or declines in their rankings
    relative to their performance in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics,
    offering a nuanced understanding of potential shifts in global
    competitiveness.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \textbf{2. First-Time Medalists Analysis:}
    
    \textbf{Extend the predictive framework to include countries that have
    yet to win an Olympic medal. Forecast the number of nations likely to
    secure their first-ever medal at the 2028 Games and estimate the
    probabilities associated with these groundbreaking achievements. This
    analysis will provide insights into the broader inclusivity of the
    Olympic movement.}
    
    \textbf{3. Event-Specific Dynamics:}
    \end{quote}
    
    \textbf{Analyze the relationship between the number and types of Olympic
    events and the medal performance of competing nations. Identify the most
    critical sports that contribute to the success of different countries
    and assess the influence of event selection by the host nation on
    overall medal outcomes. This aspect will shed light on strategic
    prioritization for both host and non-host countries.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \textbf{4. Impact of Coaching Transitions (``Coach Effect''):}
    \end{quote}
    
    \textbf{Investigate the potential influence of high-profile coaches
    switching national teams on medal performance. Quantify the contribution
    of this ``coach effect'' and recommend specific sports and countries
    where employing elite coaches could substantially enhance medal
    prospects. This analysis will provide actionable guidance for leveraging

    national sporting prowess, illuminating the intricate dynamics of global
    sporting competition.}
    
    \textbf{The perennial fascination with Olympic powerhouses draws our
    attention to an elite circle of nations that have consistently dominated
    the medal tables. Through meticulous analysis of historical data, we can
    identify these Olympic titans who have maintained their reign at the
    pinnacle of sporting excellence. These perennial champions, led by the
    United States and followed closely by sporting giants like China and UK,
    have established themselves as the true emperors of the Olympic arena,
    consistently commanding the upper echelons of the medal standings with
    remarkable persistence.}

    data before 2000 and only intercept the data after 2000 for use.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Because of the different events of each Olympic Games, the
    different events will have a huge impact on the medal. It is very
    important to ensure that the events we predict are present at the 2028
    Olympic Games. We used the latest available 2028 Los Angeles Games
    sports list (available on the official website) as a condition to
    exclude those sports that do not exist at the 2028 Games.}
    
    \textbf{In order to make better use of our time series model, we extend
    it with existing data. We created the historical medal count, starting
    from 2000, adding up gold, silver, bronze, and total medal count as our
    complementary feature. At the same time, to simplify the model, we
    combine the same rows for Sport, and de-duplicate the gold medal
    statistics for team events (because in the athlete table, a team event
    will award a gold medal to each person, but this should only be counted
    once when calculating the national gold medal count).}
    
    \textbf{To categorize events as team-based, we first compiled a list of
    sports inherently involving teams, such as Basketball, Football, and
    Volleyball. Additionally, we identified specific keywords commonly
    associated with team events, including "Team," "Doubles," "Pair,"
    "Mixed," "Four," and "Eight." By examining each event's sport and its
    name, we classified an event as a team event if it belonged to the
    predefined team sports or contained any of the team-related keywords.
    This combined approach ensures a comprehensive and accurate
    identification of team events, facilitating more precise analysis and
    modeling in our study.}

    \textbf{As there is no overall information yet on the countries
    participating in the 2028 Olympics, we can only extrapolate using what
    we knowvi. We excluded countries whose last Olympic participation was
    less than 2012. Because these countries are not likely to participate in

    the high accuracy of the model in these sports. However, for a small
    number of sports, the deviation may be due to large data fluctuations or

    \textbf{We tried some models like Xgboost, ARIMA, but they

    the Olympic Games has a very important time factor. Every four years,
    the quality of the contestants changes significantly, and the use of
    overly complex models without the use of external data increases
    entropy. So, for the countries here, we use something like a

    \textbf{Data constraints included raw data across tables with format

    \textbf{Key data integration and feature extraction steps included:}
    
    \textbf{NOC Full Name and Abbreviation Unification: Creating a country
    full name to NOC abbreviation mapping from summerOly\_athletes.csv to
    link tables. Country names in the `Team' column were cleaned to ensure
    consistency with NOC codes.}
    
    \textbf{Host Country Information Extraction: Parsing the "City, Country"
    format in summerOly\_hosts.csv `Host' column to extract and link host
    country information. Fuzzy string matching addressed name variations,
    using a similarity threshold (80\%) to match names to the athlete
    dataset\textquotesingle s `Team' column when direct matches failed.}
    
    \textbf{Feature Engineering: Engineered features include:}
    
    \textbf{a. Athlete Participation Features: Total athletes, male/female
    athlete ratio, sport/discipline diversity, athletes per event, Olympics
    participated, years since first participation. These reflect Olympic
    engagement scope.}
    
    \textbf{b. Host Country Features: Host history count, years since last
    hosting, current host status, potentially influencing medal outcomes.}
    
    \textbf{c. Historical Medal Features: Medals from recent Olympics,
    averages over recent Games, and historical totals (under hypothetical
    prior wins -- zero for countries never medaled in training). These
    indicate Olympic strength and trends.}

    \textbf{We used a Random Forest Classifier with TimeSeriesSplit
    cross-validation and SMOTE oversampling to manage class imbalance. Model
    performance was evaluated using F1-score, classification report, and
    confusion matrix. Feature importance was analyzed to identify key
    prediction drivers.}
    
    \textbf{On the validation set (2020 \& 2024 data), the model achieved an
    overall accuracy of 0.50. The F1-score for predicting first-time medal
    wins was 0.30, with precision at 0.25 and recall at 0.38 for this class.
    The confusion matrix showed that of 8 actual first-time medal winners, 3
    were correctly identified, and of 20 non-first-time winning countries,
    11 were correctly predicted. Feature importance analysis highlighted
    sport\_diversity\_count, athlete\_count\_total, athlete\_count\_male,

    participation to first medal likelihood. The Monte Carlo simulation's
    confidence interval (26-30) acknowledges prediction uncertainty.}

    \textbf{Model limitations include reliance on internal data, potentially
    missing external factors influencing Olympic success. The validation

    non-first-time winners.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Despite limitations, predictions offer insights for national

    \textbf{Applying a similar analytical lens to other nations,
    Jamaica\textquotesingle s dominance in sprinting events emerges as a
    significant factor in its Olympic success. The nation's medal tally in
    Athletics aligns almost perfectly with its performance in running
    disciplines, highlighting the disproportionate impact of sprint events
    on its overall medal outcomes. This finding is consistent with prior
    research attributing Jamaica\textquotesingle s success to cultural and
    systemic factors that favor sprinting excellence (Taylor, 2015) ix.}
    
    \textbf{In contrast, China's supremacy in Diving reflects a focused
    investment in a single discipline to achieve maximum impact. Diving
    consistently accounts for a substantial proportion of China's gold medal
    tally, showcasing the nation's strategic resource allocation and elite
    coaching systems (Zheng, 2024)x. For instance, Zheng (2024) highlights
    how China's success in Diving stems from both its technical expertise

    \textbf{To assess the general impact of performance enhancements
    potentially linked to coaching or program changes, we utilized a
    difference-in-differences (DID) model. This model examines the effect of
    a "treatment" condition, defined by either a significant performance
    breakthrough (exceeding a weighted medal score threshold) or a high
    influx of new athletes, on weighted medal scores.}
    
    \begin{quote}
    \textbf{The DID model specification is:}
    
    weighted\_score=B0+B1X Treat+e
    
    \textbf{where Weighted\_Score represents the weighted medal score, Treat
    is a binary treatment indicator, β0 is the intercept, β 1 is the
    treatment effect coefficient, and ε is the error term. Pooled OLS with
    clustered standard errors was used for estimation.}
    
    \textbf{The results of the DID model reveal a statistically significant
    and positive coefficient for the Treat variable (β 1 = 0.7904, p
    \textless{} 0.0001). This suggests a positive association between the
    defined "treatment" conditions and increased weighted medal scores.

    groups, while Figure 2 presents the coefficient estimates.}
